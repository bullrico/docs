## Build Intelligent Applications with Rails + Python

Welcome to a resource hub for Rails developers ready to integrate AI without abandoning what works. Here you'll find practical guides on architecting hybrid systems where Rails handles your web layer and Python powers your AI - the approach I use in production after 17+ years of Rails development.

## About This Site

This site documents my journey exploring the intersection of AI and web development, sharing what I've learned building production systems that combine Ruby on Rails with modern AI capabilities.

### What I Focus On

### AI Integration & Development
Exploring the intersection of AI and web applications through:
- Fine-tuning open source models for specific use cases
- Building Python-based AI services
- Integrating ML capabilities into Rails applications
- Experimenting with LLMs and classification models

### Rails Development at Scale
With experience from Rails 1 through Rails 8, I've built and scaled applications serving millions of users, from early-stage startups to enterprise platforms.

### Data Systems & Performance
Specialized in designing high-volume data processing systems, query optimization, and building analytics platforms that handle millions of records efficiently.

## Topics Covered

- **LLM Integration Patterns** — Best practices for integrating GPT-4, Claude, and open-source models
- **Production AI Architecture** — Building scalable, cost-effective AI systems
- **Rails + Python Synergy** — Combining Rails backends with Python AI services
- **Performance Optimization** — From database queries to GPU utilization
- **Real-World Solutions** — Practical approaches to common challenges

## Who Am I?

I'm Bobby Santiago, a Rails developer with 17+ years of experience who recently pivoted into AI engineering. After years building Rails applications at scale (including 6 years at SurveyMonkey), I've spent the last 2+ years diving deep into AI, teaching myself Python and ML concepts while building production systems that combine Rails with modern AI capabilities.
