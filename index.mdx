The dream is simple: build software that pays the bills and gives you the freedom to work on your own terms. As a solo developer, that means finding the right tools, the right approach, and the right opportunities to create applications that solve real problems for real money.

I've been working with Rails for most of my career, and lately, AI has become the game-changer I never saw coming. Not just for building better software, but for leveling the playing field - giving solo developers the power to compete with entire teams.

This site documents that journey. The experiments, the failures, the breakthroughs, and everything in between. If you're a solo developer dreaming of profitable apps, you're in good company.

## What's Here

[Articles](/blog) - Stories from building apps as a solo developer. Technical deep-dives, workflow improvements, and lessons learned from trying to create profitable software.

[About](/about) - Background and current projects in the pursuit of sustainable software income.

## Current Focus

Right now, I'm working on several app ideas, testing what works and what doesn't. The focus isn't just on building cool technology - it's on creating software that people will actually pay for.

AI tools have changed everything about what's possible as a solo developer. What used to require a team of specialists can now be tackled by one person with the right approach and tools.

Key insights so far:
- AI can handle tasks that used to require hiring specialists
- Rails remains an excellent foundation for building profitable apps quickly
- The biggest challenge isn't technical - it's finding problems worth solving
- Building in public creates accountability and helps refine ideas

## Background

I've been building Rails applications for most of my career, from small startups to large enterprise companies like SurveyMonkey. Now I'm focused on independent projects and the goal that's driven me from the beginning: creating software that generates sustainable income.

AI tools have completely changed what's possible as a solo developer. Instead of competing with teams of specialists, I can now leverage these tools to build comprehensive applications that would have been impossible to tackle alone.

The goal remains the same - profitable apps that solve real problems. The tools have just gotten much more powerful.
