## Current Projects

Building apps as a solo developer, experimenting with different approaches to create sustainable software income. Here's what I'm working on and what I've learned.

## Previous Experience

**SurveyMonkey** - Built large-scale Rails applications for survey tools and data processing systems. Learned how to build software that serves millions of users and generates real revenue.

## Current Focus

Working on several app concepts that leverage Rails and AI to solve real problems:

- **User-Generated Content Tools** - Helping creators and businesses manage content at scale
- **Developer Productivity Apps** - Tools that make solo development more efficient  
- **AI-Enhanced SaaS** - Traditional software problems solved with modern AI capabilities

The goal is finding the intersection of problems worth solving and solutions that can generate sustainable revenue.

## Tools & Approach

**Primary Stack:** Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis - the foundation for rapid application development  
**AI Integration:** OpenAI, Claude, and other APIs to add intelligence where it makes sense  
**Deployment:** Docker and cloud platforms for simple, reliable hosting  
**Development:** Focus on shipping quickly and iterating based on user feedback
