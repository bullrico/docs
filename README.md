# README — Bobby Santiago's AI + Rails Developer Hub

Welcome!

This repository powers my **AI + Ruby on Rails Developer Hub** — a documentation-style site built with Mintlify.  
It serves as my public-facing portfolio, blog, and knowledge base, highlighting my journey as a **Senior Rails Developer**, **AI Engineer** and **solopreneur**.

## What You'll Find Here
This project is more than just a personal site — it's a living record of my work, ideas, and experiments in **web application development**.

Inside, you'll find:
- **Blog posts** exploring AI integration with Rails, solo development workflows, and performance tuning.
- **Portfolio case studies** of past work, including Rails, AI projects and large-scale production applications.
- **Downloadable resume** and a concise overview of my career.
- **Contact information** for freelance or consulting opportunities.

## Why This Exists
The tech world is evolving fast — AI is no longer a buzzword; it’s an engineering reality.  
This site reflects how I:
- Apply **17+ years of Rails experience** to modern AI challenges.
- Use AI as a **force multiplier for solo and small-team development**.
- Build maintainable, scalable applications that leverage the latest in LLM technology.

## Tech Stack
While Mintlify handles much of the frontend and layout, the content, structure, and strategy are my own.  
Expect regular updates as I publish new blog posts and showcase recent projects.
