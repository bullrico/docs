I'm a Rails developer on a mission to build profitable applications as a solo developer. After years of working for others, I'm now focused on creating software that can generate sustainable income and provide the freedom to work independently.

## Background

I've been building Rails applications for most of my career, working across the full stack and helping startups launch their products. The goal has always been the same: create software that solves real problems and generates real value.

Recently, AI tools have completely changed the game for solo developers. What used to require entire teams can now be accomplished by one person with the right tools and approach. This shift has made pursuing profitable app development more realistic than ever.

## Current Work

Right now I'm working on several app ideas, testing what resonates with users and what can generate sustainable revenue. The focus areas include:

- Building Rails applications enhanced with AI capabilities
- Experimenting with different monetization models and user acquisition strategies
- Documenting what works (and what doesn't) for other solo developers
- Leveraging AI tools to compete with larger development teams

The goal isn't just to build cool technology - it's to create applications that people will pay for and that can support an independent lifestyle.

## Technical Background

**Backend:** Ruby, Rails, Redis, PostgreSQL  
**Frontend:** JavaScript, React, TailwindCSS  
**AI/ML:** Python, FastAPI, various LLM APIs  
**Infrastructure:** Docker, Linux environments

I document this journey through articles and posts, sharing both successes and failures to help other solo developers pursuing similar goals.

## Contact

If you're a solo developer working toward financial independence through profitable apps, I'd love to connect and compare notes.
