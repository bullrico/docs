I'm a Rails developer who's been working with the framework since 2006. I spent several years at SurveyMonkey and am currently working independently on AI integration projects.

## Background

I started with Rails during the early framework days and have worked across the full stack - Ruby, Rails, JavaScript frameworks, and the usual web development tools. The work has mostly involved building web applications and helping startups get their products launched.

Since 2022, I've been learning Python and figuring out how to integrate AI services with Rails applications. It's been a process of trial and error, but I'm starting to see patterns that work.

## Current Work

Right now I'm focused on:

- Connecting Rails apps to Python AI services
- Building RAG systems that actually work in production
- Local LLM deployment and optimization
- Making AI tools more accessible for individual developers

The AI space moves quickly and there's still a lot I'm figuring out, but that's part of what makes it interesting.

## Technical Background

**Backend:** Ruby, Rails, Redis, PostgreSQL  
**Frontend:** JavaScript, React, TailwindCSS  
**AI/ML:** Python, FastAPI, various LLM APIs  
**Infrastructure:** Docker, Linux environments

I write about some of this work occasionally, mostly documenting what I've learned and what hasn't worked as expected.
