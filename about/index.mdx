## Hi, I'm Bobby

I'm a **designer who develops and a developer who designs** — a Senior Rails Developer with 17+ years of experience who's recently pivoted into AI engineering. Since 2022, I've been exploring the intersection of AI and web development, combining my deep Rails expertise with emerging AI technologies. I believe the best code tells a story that's elegant, maintainable, and solves real problems.

## My Journey

### From Creativity to Code
My career began in advertising as a creative director, where I learned that the best solutions come from understanding both the problem and the people it affects. This creative foundation shapes how I approach engineering today — always considering the human element in technical decisions.

### The Rails Years
I discovered Ruby on Rails in 2006 and never looked back. The framework's emphasis on convention, clarity, and developer happiness aligned perfectly with my philosophy. Over 6+ years, I've helped startups launch alpha, beta, and 2.0 versions, working across the full stack with minimal supervision. My expertise spans:

- **Backend & Infrastructure**: Ruby, Rails, Redis, Git, Haml/SASS
- **Frontend & Mobile**: Backbone.js, CoffeeScript, jQuery, jQueryMobile
- **Testing & Quality**: RSpec, Cucumber, Capybara
- **Design & UX**: Solving complex user experience problems
- **Full-Stack Projects**: Single-page applications and complete product development

### The AI Pivot (2022-Present)
When ChatGPT launched and the AI revolution began, I recognized a paradigm shift. Starting in 2022, I began teaching myself Python, FastAPI, and machine learning concepts while building real systems. Today, I'm focused on:

- Integrating LLMs into existing Rails applications
- Building RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems
- Implementing semantic search and recommendation engines
- Optimizing AI workloads for production environments

## What Drives Me

### Developer Experience Matters
I believe great tools make great developers. Whether it's crafting clean APIs, writing comprehensive documentation, or building intuitive interfaces, I prioritize the developer experience in everything I create.

### AI as a Force Multiplier
I'm passionate about democratizing AI capabilities. Small teams and solo developers should have access to the same powerful tools as big tech companies. My work focuses on making AI integration accessible, practical, and maintainable.

### Continuous Learning
Technology evolves rapidly, and I embrace that challenge. I'm constantly experimenting with new tools, frameworks, and approaches — always looking for better ways to solve problems.

## Beyond the Code

### Writing
I regularly write about AI, Rails, and the intersection of technology and creativity. My articles focus on practical insights and real-world applications rather than theoretical concepts.

### Mentorship
Having benefited from incredible mentors throughout my career, I'm committed to helping the next generation of developers. I regularly mentor through various platforms.

### A Few Things That Make Me, Me
My journey to becoming a designer-developer has been anything but conventional. I earned my BS in Electrical Engineering from the University of Massachusetts (Dean's List), where I aced an electromagnetics exam taught by a NASA professor. But my path has always been about crossing boundaries:

- **Design Heritage**: I was part of the design team for Timex Indiglo watches and sold my first acrylic painting at age 5
- **Creative Versatility**: I've sung backup on a TV commercial I conceptualized, recorded all 8 tracks of a song playing every instrument, and even designed an actual house on a lark
- **Global Perspective**: I served as Steve McCurry's guide through rebel country in the Philippines in the '80s and helped feed evacuees after Mt. Pinatubo erupted
- **Performance Under Pressure**: I've played drums before 4,500 screaming fans, led a winning pitch against the country's top ad agency, and maintained an undefeated streak as a Spelling Bee champion through sixth grade
- **Lifelong Mac Enthusiast**: Using Mac since 1985 — some habits never change

I'm ambidextrous, can tell cabernet sauvignon from merlot, and yes, I once dunked a basketball. These experiences taught me that the best solutions often come from unexpected combinations of skills and perspectives.

## My Approach

### Pragmatic Over Perfect
I believe in shipping working software that solves real problems. Perfect is the enemy of good, and iteration beats procrastination every time.

### Clear Communication
Complex problems require clear thinking and clear communication. I pride myself on explaining technical concepts in ways that stakeholders at all levels can understand.

### Results-Driven
At the end of the day, technology is a means to an end. I focus on delivering measurable business value, whether that's increased revenue, reduced costs, or improved user satisfaction.

## Current Focus

### AI Application Development
I'm particularly excited about:

- **AI-Powered Development Tools** — Building tools that help developers work more efficiently
- **RAG Systems at Scale** — Making knowledge bases truly intelligent and context-aware
- **The Solo Developer Renaissance** — How AI enables individuals to build what previously required teams
- **Fine-tuning Open Source Models** — Optimizing models for classification and domain-specific NLP tasks
- **FastAPI Services** — Building high-performance AI inference APIs
- **Python-Rails Integration** — Bridging ML pipelines with Ruby on Rails backends

## Let's Connect

I'm always interested in connecting with fellow developers, discussing challenging problems, or exploring potential collaborations.
